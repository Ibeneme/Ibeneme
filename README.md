# About Me

🚀 Hey there! I’m a passionate software engineer with expertise across multiple stacks, from full-stack web development to mobile app development. I thrive on building innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible.

🌐 On the web side, I’m proficient in Express.js, TypeScript, React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, Angular, and Ionic. Whether it’s crafting robust APIs, architecting scalable web applications, or diving into the latest frontend technologies, I love bringing ideas to life on the web.

📱 When it comes to mobile app development, I’m your go-to guy. With skills in Swift, Objective-C, and React Native, I have the tools to create seamless, intuitive mobile experiences across iOS and Android platforms. My experience with Ionic allows me to develop hybrid mobile applications that provide an engaging user experience.

🧠 Currently, I’m part of the talented team behind Africa’s leading AI, ‘CHATWAZOBIA AI’. We’re committed to transforming how people engage with technology. By harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence, we’re creating innovative solutions that truly matter. Our goal is to break language barriers and facilitate global connections by making chat translation seamless across all languages.

👨‍💻 Whether it’s coding up a storm, collaborating with like-minded individuals, or diving deep into the latest tech trends, I’m always up for a challenge. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. And yes, even in my downtime, I’m always thinking about ways to innovate and create.
